    <h4>About me</h4>
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>I'm a 39 year old aspiring programmer.  I currently work at Trader joes and before that I was an HVAC/sheetmetal worker.  I started taking the intro class At Epicodus because what little coding I've done was really <em>fun</em> and <strong>challenging.</strong>  I have alway liked to create and tinker with things so coding seemed like a great choice.  I also want to pursue a career in coding so I can take care of my family.  My hobbies include skateboarding, hiking, climbing, and programming!  My goal is to have programming be a profession and not just a hobby.</p>
