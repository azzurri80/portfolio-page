    <h2>About me</h2>
    <blockquote class="bg-info">
    <p>I'm a 39 year old aspiring programmer.  I currently work at Trader joes and before that I was an HVAC/sheetmetal worker.  I started taking the intro class At Epicodus because what little coding that I have done was really fun and challenging.  I have alway like to create and tinker with things so coding seemed like a great choice.  I also want to pursue a carrer coding so I can take care of my family.</p>
